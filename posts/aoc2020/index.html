				<p>edit 2021-05-15: Yeah, I&rsquo;m probably not going to finish writing this. Too many things came up; most of the cool things I did are long forgotten; I&rsquo;ve (kind of?) moved on to new interests.</p>
<p><a href="https://adventofcode.com"><em>Advent of Code</em></a> is an annual programming event that spans &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; the month of December. Challenges are released at midnight for the first 25 days, and programmers race to develop working solutions to solve each problem. Also, there&rsquo;s usually a fun theme to go along with the challenges, this year being built around taking a vacation (during covid, somehow?! someone needs to put the North Pole under lockdown).</p>
<p>This was my second year participating in the challenge, and although I don&rsquo;t think I <em>feel</em> like I learned as much as last year, I certainly have quite a bit to share. So, this post is where I&rsquo;m setting out to do that! I&rsquo;ll update it as I write more, but I plan to eventually cover how I approached some of problems, especially if there was an interesting or really solid way of solving them.</p>

<h3 id="day-1-report-repair">Day 1: Report Repair</h3>
<p>Expectedly, the challenges start off simple &ndash; today&rsquo;s problem is a simple question of finding a subset of numbers with a given length out of a given set that sum to 2020. <a href="https://github.com/val-is/advent-of-code/blob/main/2020/day01.py">My initial approach</a> was simply to throw a few nested for loops at it. This <em>works</em> of course, but I wouldn&rsquo;t consider it to be very elegant.</p>
<p>A slightly more elegant solution (feels more elegant.) would be to abuse <code>itertools</code> to take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product">cartesian product</a> of our inputs &ndash; a nifty way to get the valid subsets (granted, there&rsquo;s only one ;) ) for this might be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">solutions <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [ss <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> ss <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> map(set, itertools<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>product(inputs, repeat<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>))
                <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> len(ss) <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span> <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> sum(ss) <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2020</span>]

<span style="color:#66d9ef">print</span>(np<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>prod([<span style="color:#f92672">*</span>solutions[<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>]))
</code></pre></div><p>Outside of itertools, the only tricky thing being done here is taking advantage of the fact that the <code>set</code> type consists of unique values to get rid of duplicates (that&rsquo;s the <code>len</code> check).</p>
<h3 id="day-2-password-philosophy-delete">Day 2: Password Philosophy (delete?)</h3>
<p>The second day is also not that bad, and can be solved in a pretty staightforwards way. You&rsquo;re given a list of password policies and passwords, and the goal is to find and count the number of valid passwords in an input file. In all honesty, this is probably one of the most Advent of Codey problems that there is &ndash; it&rsquo;s all about parsing and validation.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/val-is/advent-of-code/blob/main/2020/day02.py">My solution to this problem</a> wasn&rsquo;t terribly complicated or anything: on each line, we just quickly parsing in the input, splitting out the password rule, and evaluating it. I can&rsquo;t think of a more effective way of doing this to be honest, but if I were to rewrite it, I&rsquo;d like to make use of a regex &ndash; this way, we can condense a lot of the logic into one line while making it more readable (as a <em>simple</em> regex) at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="day-4-passport-processing">Day 4: Passport Processing</h3>
<p><em>Passport Processing</em> was an&hellip; interesting problem, though I found it to be a bit tedious to implement. The gist of it is that you&rsquo;re given a set of rules (problem descritpion) that passports (test input) have to follow. The parsing for this problem isn&rsquo;t the <em>easiest</em> by any means, but really that&rsquo;s all that the problem <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this was a great problem to show off some non-obvious ways to implement repetitive/hard to read code in Python! One of the tricks in <a href="https://github.com/val-is/advent-of-code/blob/main/2020/day04.py">my solution</a> was to use a dictionary as a lookup table for checks:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#75715e"># abridged implementation of field validation</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">check_fields</span>():
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> field <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> passport:
        <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#f92672">not</span> {
            <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;byr&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">lambda</span> x: <span style="color:#ae81ff">1920</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> int(x) <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2002</span>,
            <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;iyr&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">lambda</span> x: <span style="color:#ae81ff">2010</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> int(x) <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2020</span>,
            <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;hcl&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">lambda</span> x: re<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>match(<span style="color:#e6db74">r</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;^#[0-9a-f]{6}$&#34;</span>, x) <span style="color:#f92672">!=</span> None,
            <span style="color:#75715e"># ...</span>
        }<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>get(field, <span style="color:#66d9ef">lambda</span> x: True)(port[field]):
            <span style="color:#75715e"># invalidate passport</span>
            <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> False
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> True
</code></pre></div><p>This method doesn&rsquo;t really hold <em>that</em> many advantages over just writing out a bunch of if statements, in terms of performance, however. I&rsquo;d expect that if anything, it&rsquo;s probably slightly less performant&hellip; but fortunately, it would only be by a constant amount at worst. To better optimize this, I&rsquo;d just declare the dict outside of the scope of the function to be absolutely certain that it doesn&rsquo;t get redeclared on each call.</p>
<h3 id="day-5-binary-boarding">Day 5: Binary Boarding</h3>
<p>Out of all the problems in the first week, <em>Binary Boarding</em> was probably the best written one (IMO). The straightforward solution of filling out a tree is right there, but just under the surface is the much more interesting method of doing some bit level scheananigans.
The bit string based solution is really quite simple &ndash; knowing that each choice being made between different seating patterns (ex: F/B or R/L) will split the number of potential seats in half, and that the entire string we&rsquo;re given maps to one specific seat <em>probably</em> gives the trick away.
Basically, what we need to do is recognize that each input string given to us is actually a binary encoded seating position, and from there, the rest of the problem falls into place.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick representation of what one of the seats might look like after we load it in:</p>
<pre><code>BFFFBBF RRR
1000110 111 =&gt; 567
</code></pre><p>From here, the first part is <em>incredibly</em> simple, all we have to do is load all of our seats in as decimal values, and then just find the highest seat value that we have.
The second part of the problem is basically just about finding a gap in the seats &ndash; the only real catch here is making sure that your code is aware that there might be seats at the front or back of the plane missing.
My approach to this wasn&rsquo;t too bad; all I ended up doing was sorting the set of seat IDs to make finding the gap easier, starting at the lowest known value, and then working backwards to find a gap.</p>
